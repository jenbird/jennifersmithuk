### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:computer: Iâ€™m currently working:

- On a platform for [Signalise Co-op](https://signalise.coop), a co-operative of interpreters and Deaf people, co-creating a platform to enable organisations to book sign language interpreters. 

- I also work on small to medium business websites. My portfolio is seriously out of date and I'm sure one day I will find time to update it.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently honing my JavaScript and React.js skills  

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about platform co-ops

:nerd_face: I'm interested in #techforgood, #womenintech
